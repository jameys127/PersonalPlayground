# My "User Story" for this project

- [ ] Front page for my stuff
- [ ] Login system because why not
- [ ] Display some projects that I am currently working on
- [ ] Provide a space to add projects that I may do in the future.
- [ ] I had a thought to make it my repository all things to do with the vampire game but I don't know about that anymore.
- [ ] Maybe each page of the each project can have customizable themes.
- [ ] Have info on projects like Jira that can track progress.
- [ ] Different face for public vs me when logging in so public see's the project and stuff and I can actually use it to track my progress.
